### **Usage**

Specify full directory path to `../ExistentialsimBear/` folder of cloned and compiled [ExistentialismBear](https://github.com/WhiteheadV/ExistentialistBear) in "__main.py__", line 76.  
Use the bot by joining [?programming](https://hack.chat/?programming) and typing |h to get a list of commands.
